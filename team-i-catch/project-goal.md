
#Fraudulent data


#Dataset

The available data simulate mobile money transactions based on a subset of real-world finanical transactions taken from a month-window from a mobile money service in an African country.

The data are available here: https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1  



#Modeling strategy

- Build a binary classifier to predict whether the transaction is fraudulent 
- Use ensemble methods to increase the predictive capability of the model
- Utilize additional model performance indicators including recall, precision, and f1 score to account for the imbalanced dataset
