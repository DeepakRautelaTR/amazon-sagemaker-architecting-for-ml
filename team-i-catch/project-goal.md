
# Fraudulent data


# Dataset

The data are available here: https://www.kaggle.com/ntnu-testimon/paysim1  



# Modeling strategy

- Build a binary classifier to predict whether the transaction is fraudulent 
- Use ensemble methods to increase the predictive capability of the model
- Utilize additional model performance indicators including recall, precision, and f1 score to account for the imbalanced dataset 




# End goal
