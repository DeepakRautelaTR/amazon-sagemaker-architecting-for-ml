
# Fraudulent data
There are billions of banking transactions in the U.S. alone every year.  A small portion of those transactions are fraudulent, which can have devastating results to all parties involved.  

# Dataset

The available data simulate mobile money transactions based on a subset of real-world finanical transactions taken from a month-window from a mobile money service in an African country.

# Modeling strategy

- Build a binary classifier to predict whether the transaction is fraudulent 
- Use ensemble methods to increase the predictive capability of the model
- Utilize additional model performance indicators including recall, precision, and f1 score to account for the imbalanced dataset 




# End goal
A predictive classification model that can detect whether a transation is fraudulent. The final model should accurately predict transactions from the current dataset.  However, the final goal would be to extend the model capabilities to financial transactions from other months and other countries.
